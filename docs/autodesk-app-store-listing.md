**Supercharge Your Revit Workflow with BIMKraft**

BIM Kraft Tools is a comprehensive suite of 6 professional-grade tools designed to dramatically increase productivity in Autodesk Revit. Whether you're managing complex projects, collaborating with large teams, or performing detailed quality control, BIMKraft streamlines your workflow and saves hours every week.

**🎯 What You Get**

**Parameter Pro**
Advanced parameter management for power users. Batch edit parameters across thousands of elements, create and manage shared parameters, filter and search with precision, and save parameter configurations as reusable presets. Perfect for maintaining consistency across projects and project templates.

**Parameter Transfer Pro**
Intelligently transfer parameter values between different element types. Create flexible mappings (source → target), process entire categories or selections, and save transfer configurations for recurring workflows. Ideal for copying design data, transferring specifications, and maintaining parameter consistency.

**Workset Manager**
Rule-based workset assignment for efficient collaboration. Apply 6 built-in presets for common scenarios (architectural, structural, MEP) or create custom rules based on category, class, parameter values, type names, or family names. Automatically creates worksets and processes entire projects in seconds.

**Warnings Browser Pro**
Advanced warning analysis and resolution tracking. Filter by severity, category, or keywords. Group similar warnings for batch resolution. Export to Excel/CSV for team tracking. Zoom directly to problematic elements. Essential for maintaining model health and passing quality checks.

**Line Length Calculator**
Calculate connected line lengths with precision. Auto-groups lines by style and connectivity. Assign colors for visualization. Apply color overrides to lines in views. Export detailed reports to Excel/CSV. Create Revit groups from line groups. Perfect for detail line takeoffs and construction quantity estimates.

**Family Renamer**
Batch rename families with powerful operations. Add prefixes or suffixes, find and replace text, apply sequential numbering, and remove unwanted characters. Preview changes before applying. Filter by category or search. Maintain naming standards across projects effortlessly.
